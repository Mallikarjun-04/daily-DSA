# 📘 Daily Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Practice

Welcome to my **daily-DSA** repository! This space is dedicated to my **consistent practice and implementation of Data Structures and Algorithms problems**.

As a final-year B.Tech student in **Computer Science Engineering (Data Science)**, I believe that **discipline in daily problem-solving is the key** to mastering core concepts and developing a strong algorithmic mindset — essential for technical interviews and building robust applications.

## 📌 About This Repository

This repository is a **testament to my commitment to continuous learning**. Each day, I solve DSA problems with a focus on:

- 📈 Improving **problem-solving efficiency**
- ⚙️ Writing **clean, readable, and well-commented code**
- 🔁 Exploring **alternative approaches and optimizations**
- 📚 Gradually **covering a wide range of DSA topics**, from arrays and strings to graphs and dynamic programming

Problems are sourced from platforms like **LeetCode**, **GeeksforGeeks**, **CodeStudio**, and others.

## 🧠 My DSA Approach

- **Consistency:** I treat DSA as a daily habit — not a sprint, but a marathon.
- **Strategy First:** I spend time understanding the problem before jumping into code.
- **Optimized Solutions:** I aim for the best possible time and space complexity.
- **Code Quality:** Every solution is written with clarity and structured comments.
- **Review & Improve:** I revisit past problems to improve or refactor them.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript  
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub, Visual Studio Code  
- **Practicing On:** LeetCode, GFG, CodeStudio, and more

## 💡 Why DSA Matters to Me

As a **software developer and full-stack intern**, I’ve seen firsthand how fundamental DSA knowledge improves both frontend and backend logic. During my internship at **IT People Corporation**, I worked on **real-world applications using the MERN stack** and participated in agile workflows — where performance, logic, and scalability mattered.

Combining that experience with daily DSA practice sharpens both my **interview readiness** and **practical coding skills**.
